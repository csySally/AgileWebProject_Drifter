# DRIFTER

## About the Application

In this fast-paced world, everyone's heart harbours unspoken mysteries and late-night musings. Do those unspoken secrets in casual conversations or written silently on the pages of your diary sometimes make you feel lonely and helpless? Have you ever wanted to find an outlet for those questions?

Welcome to "Drifter" - a unique platform for your questions to fly freely in an anonymous world. Here, everyone can be a listener and a sharer. Whether it's late-night blues, dawn doubts, or those flashes of inspiration and things you haven't told others, they can all find their home here.

"Drifter" makes the power of anonymity gentle and powerful. There are no preconceived prejudices, only stories waiting to be discovered and mysteries to be solved. Send a secret note and it will randomly fly to a corner of the world; reply to a stranger's query and your words may become a beacon for them. In the process, different people will gather around a secret or question, sharing their perspectives so that everyone's experience is resonated and understood.

Please speak up at Drifter!

## Deisgn

In "Drifter", our design concept was to create a warm, simple and inclusive platform for anonymous communication. The idea was inspired by some famous dating apps, but our platform is not about making friends, it is about getting different responses to one's thoughts, so that everyone can feel free to speak their mind. Designer <b>Sally Chen</b>, chose pink and blue as the main colours, soft colours that convey a sense of calm and comfort, helping users to feel relaxed, quiet, gentle and happy during use.

Simple interaction design is another major feature. A simple and intuitive interface reduces the cost of learning.

The UI design of the website was done through <b>Figma</b> and all sketches are included in the deliverable folder.https://www.figma.com/design/SqRgaZQaXlgRzC7S6k2ZZA/Drifter?node-id=2%3A352&t=fnpLmyMZOMQvr4Jc-1

Anonymity is a core element of "Drifter". Here, everyone is free to express their true feelings and thoughts without the constraints of identity. This anonymity not only protects the privacy of the users, but also provides a safe environment for them to speak out what would normally be difficult for them to say.

We welcome everyone with a story in their heart to come to "Drifter" and find a place to talk and resonate with each other.
